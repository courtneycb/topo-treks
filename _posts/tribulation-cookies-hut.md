Tribulation hut and Cookies hut are both basic huts, each with 6 bunk beds, a non flushable toilet, and a river nearby for water. Cookies hut also has a fireplace. The hike to Tribulation hut is roughly 10km, with Cookies hut another 4km up the river. Due to flooding, some of the track has been washed out and is tough to navigate at times.

## Getting there

The start of the track is along Double Hill Run road, just before the bridge over Redcliffe stream. It is easily missed as there is not great signage. The road is shingle, and there are a couple of fords you will need to cross. If it has been raining recently you may not be able to get through the fords unless you are in a ute or truck. There is a chance you will encounter stock along the way as there a numerous farms nearby. There is space on the side of the road to park your car.

## Tribulation hut

The track to Tribulation hut starts by walking up the river bed for roughly 1km then gets onto an easement track. There are a good number of DOC markers to follow. If it has been raining recently be prepared to get your boots wet early. We walked this in the peak of summer and it was quite overgrown, the track was still visible but the grass alongside it was getting in our faces.

At around the 4km mark, we came across a chunk of the track that had been washed away. We decided to head up the short and steep hill on our left instead of following the cliff edge as there was a lot of matagouri/tÅ«matakuru.
